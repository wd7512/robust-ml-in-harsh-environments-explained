## Build and Deploy Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies (including gh-pages) are installed.

2. Then run:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

This will build and deploy your app to GitHub Pages at:

If you get an error running `npm run deploy`, try running:

```
npm run
```

to list all available scripts and verify "deploy" is present.

If it’s missing, double-check you saved the edited package.json and are in the correct project folder.
